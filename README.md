# Crowdfunding Product Page

This is a simple and responsive Crowdfunding page.

## How It Works

There is a few interactions in this project:
- Back this Project: a button that opens a menu where you can choose a specific plan and the amount of money that will be pledged.
- Bookmark: simple interaction, changing the color of the icon and the text of "Bookmark" to "Bookmarked".
- Select Reward: this button opens the same menu as "Back this Project", the difference is that already selects the same plan of the "Select Reward" button you pressed.
- Thank You Message: a message that appears after each pledge and, also, when the max budget is achieved.
- Mobile Menu: simple interation aswell, a menu bar that only appears in smaller screens that open the nav bar.
- Progress Bar: is not a interaction per se, but shows the total backed in a percentage way.
